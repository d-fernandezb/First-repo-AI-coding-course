# First-repo-AI-coding-course

A small web project: a "guess what's inside" page that reveals an eagle image after clicking through a sequence of buttons.

## What it does

- Start with a single button: **Guess what's inside**.
- Each click reveals the next button and hides the current one.
- After the last button, the page shows a secret section with an eagle image.

## How to run

1. Clone the repo (or open the folder).
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or drag into the browser).

No build step or server required.

## Project structure

- `index.html` – Main page and structure
- `styles.css` – Layout and button styles
- `script.js` – Button click logic and show/hide behavior
- `images/eagle.jpg` – Revealed image
- `totem.txt` – Project totem file
